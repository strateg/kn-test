Test task - ExchangeRatesAPI

Write Java command-line program that retrieves data from exchange rates public API at https://exchangeratesapi.io/.

Input from user:
- Base currency
- Target currency

Program output:
- Current exchange rate for base currency to target currency
- The lowest base currency rate to target currency in the current month
- The highest base currency rate to target currency in the current month
- Provide correct human-readable error message if currency is not supported

Requirements
- Code should be covered by tests (ideally use jUnit + Mockito)
- Code should follow best practices like Clean Code by Robert C. Martin: https://dzone.com/articles/clean-code-summary-and-key-points
- Maven (preferably) or Gradle should be used as building tool
- Use Docker to deliver application (no additional installations except Docker should be required at host machine). Would be great, but not mandatory, to publish your Docker image to hub.docker.com
- Upload source code to any public Git repository
- Using Spring/SpringBoot is recommended, but not mandatory
